# Wallet

This was a challenge we faced at the Apple Developer Academy, where we attempted to replicate a native iOS app.

We chose certain features of the app to replicate as a way to learn more about it, including:

- Face ID
- Payment recognition
- Credit card info recognition

Furthermore, we aimed to recreate the same design and animations!
